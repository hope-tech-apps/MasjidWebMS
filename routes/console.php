// devices that have gone dark (no heartbeat > 5 days) so they never miss a
// reminder even if their local schedule lapsed. Active devices are excluded, so
// no duplicates. withoutOverlapping() guards against a slow run stacking up.

// prayer times and re-arm their rolling notification window, so the buffer stays

// (after midnight local, before Fajr). Complements the 6-day buffer.
