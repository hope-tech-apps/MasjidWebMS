# DECISIONS

_Append-only. Each entry: date · decision · alternatives · rationale._

## 2026-06-24 — Backend-driven content, not hardcoded per masjid
Decision: masjid identity (name, brand, About/Mission/Vision, theme,
donation link) is stored in the DB per `masjid_id` and served to all
consumers, never hardcoded in web/app/backend code. The Al-Fateh →
Burlington rebrand was executed as DB + seeder edits, not string swaps.
Alternatives: hardcode Burlington strings/assets per platform (fastest
for one masjid). Rationale: the system is multi-tenant by design; a
hardcoded brand would have to be found and edited in 4+ codebases for
every future masjid and would drift out of sync. One DB source keeps web
+ apps + tv consistent and makes onboarding a new masjid a data change.

## 2026-06-25 — Single-source content via a serialize-time binder
Decision: the four "content" section types (about_us, mission_vision,
donation, contact_form) render from their dedicated models via
`app/Support/SectionContentBinder`, injected when the V1 PageSection
Resource serializes — rather than storing a second copy in the page
builder's free-form `Section.content` JSON. A `filled()` guard falls
back to stored content if the model is empty (non-destructive).
Alternatives: (a) leave the duplicate section editors and ask admins to
edit twice; (b) migrate the page-builder blob into the models
destructively. Rationale: the page-builder blob is entity-unbound, so
About/Donate prose was being edited twice (web section vs the model the
apps read). Binding at serialize time gives one edit surface, preserves
the exact Nuxt payload shape, and is reversible (drop the binder).

## 2026-06-26 — Per-section `settings.bind` for Burlington's custom layout
Decision: extend the binder with a per-section `settings.bind` directive
so Burlington's About rendered via a generic `image_text_grid` (§13) and
Mission/Vision via `grid_cards` (§14) also pull from `MasjidAbout`,
matching into `content.text` / `items[]` by title keyword while keeping
layout/heading/card-titles. Alternatives: rebuild those pages using the
canonical about_us/mission_vision section types. Rationale: the existing
layout was already approved/live; binding by directive avoided a page
rebuild while still collapsing the edit-twice problem for the real prose.

## 2026-07-23 — Super-Admin masjid onboarding wizard
Decision: turn the manual per-tenant onboarding into one Super-Admin
wizard + a single transactional `OnboardingController@provision`
(`POST /api/admin/onboarding/provision`, own prefix under the admin group,
`super`-gated). One call creates the masjid + theme + about + prayer-calc +
iqama + jumaa + donation link + social links + default feature toggles +
app-publishing config. Per-platform app publishing (`masjid_app_publishing`
table + `MasjidAppPublishing` model) records `managed` (org publishes, paid
tier) vs `byo`; BYO Apple ASC .p8/key-id/issuer-id and Google Play
service-account JSON are stored via Laravel `encrypted` casts, `$hidden`, and
NEVER returned — reads expose only `has_asc_key` / `has_play_service_account`
booleans. Validation is a FormRequest (`ProvisionMasjidRequest extends
BaseFormRequest`) so failures throw the legacy `{status:'failed'}` envelope,
never a raw ValidationException. Wizard posts one nested payload as a real
`FormData` (axios 1.16 drops the global multipart header and lets the browser
set the boundary; Laravel re-parses bracket keys into nested arrays validated
with dot rules); a `feature_keys_provided` flag disambiguates an
all-unchecked selection from an omitted field (multipart drops empty arrays).
Alternatives: reuse `MasjidsController@store` + N follow-up save calls from
the client (multi-request, non-atomic, partial-tenant risk on failure);
JSON body (the app's global content-type is multipart, and nested JSON
doesn't round-trip through the existing form-post convention). Rationale: one
atomic transaction can't leave a half-provisioned tenant; reusing each
config's existing rules/models keeps parity; secrets-as-encrypted-never-echoed
is the security-critical invariant. Scope note: the wizard configures the
"minutes after adhan" iqama model and a single Jumu'ah iqama time; the richer
fixed per-date iqama ranges stay in the dedicated Iqama screen post-onboarding.
